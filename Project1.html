      <p>This just a test project.</p>
      <h2>Goal</h2>
      <p>Develop a mobile interface that makes it easy for users to match, browse, and eventually adopt their furry new friend.</p>

            <h1>Design Process</h1>
            <h2>Crafting the Personas</h2>
            <h3>We began with the creation of four personas based off different common user needs:</h3>
             <ul>
               <li>emotional support</li>
              <li>security</li>
              <li>companionship for pet</li>
              <li>companionship for owner</li>
            </ul>
             <h2>Mapping the User Journey</h2>
            <p>Based off of the personas, my team and I created a consumer journey map that reflected the <b>goals, feelings, and concerns</b> of a user who would be a first time dog owner.
              By examining the journey map, we were able to locate identify the points of crisis within the user's journey. Solutions for these crisis points are the most important to incorporate into our design.       
             Our ultimate goal for the MatchDog service was to get the dogs in the organization adopted, and our journey map helped us envision where users might hesitate to make the jump toward adoption. 
             From the map, we highlighted these specific pain points to focus on once we started designing:</p>
             <ul>
                 <li>Too many dogs to choose from, don't know which is most compatible</li>
                <li>Unsure what to expect when adopting a dog</li>
                <li>Not confident in ability to best take care of new dog</li>
            </ul>

      <h2>Developing the Conceptual Model</h2>
      <p>My team and I worked to create a conceptual model that embodied what the user's needs and goals are, and how they are prioritized. Cooperatively building the conceptual model prior to designing the actual product allowed us to ensure that we were consistent in our design while maintaining simplicity.</p>

        <h2>Choreographing the User Experience</h2>
        <p>The user's experience flow must be carefully mapped, not only to ensure that necessary screens are completed, but also to prevent users from getting lost in the flow. When a user loses their way in the general flow, it can often be more detrimental to their experience than when there is ambiguity within a specific screen. </p>
        <p>My objective in creating the user experience flow was to make decision paths clear and guide the user toward their goal. In this flow, the goal was to have the user <b>successfully adopt a dog.</b></p>

                    <h2>Sketching the Idea</h2>
                    <p>I started sketching out ideas to map out the skeleton of the app prior to working on low-fidelity wireframes. Sketching allows me to visualize the multiple paths I can take before committing to one.</p>
                    <p>I worked on sketches that made the user experience more focused on the actions of the application (like adopting, matching, and donating) and I also worked on sketches that focused on the objects (like the dogs, users, and the organization).</p>
                    <p>Ultimately, my team came to the consensus that the most important feature of our app was to help users adopt dogs. This drove our decision to go with an action-orientated navigation system, so that users can easily understand what they're able to do with the application.</p>

                <p>After solidifying the conceptual model and grammar with my team, I worked on my low-fidelity wireframe in Axure RP 9. I presented this in class during our interim design review. Some of the feedback I received on my design was to show the percentage of compatibility between the user and the dog for all the dogs, not just the dogs that were rated highest for compatibility.</p>

            <p>Following my low-fidelity wireframes, I built out a high-fidelity prototype through Axure RP 9 to incorporate the feedback I was given. I designed the app with the main user goals in mind so that users can easily find the pathways to adopt a dog or get started by matching with a compatible pet.</p>
